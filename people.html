            <h3>Eva Dyer</h3>
            <p>Eva Dyer (she/they) is the Rachleff Family Associate Professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Dyer leads the NerDS Lab, which focuses on representation learning, generative modeling, and AI for science. A key area of the lab’s research focuses on AI for neuroscience, where they aim to develop tools to better understand the brain and neural computation, and to uncover abstractions of natural intelligence for creating new brain-inspired AI. Eva earned all of their degrees in Electrical & Computer Engineering, including a Ph.D. and M.S. from Rice University and a B.S. from the University of Miami. Eva has received numerous honors, including a Sloan Fellowship, NSF CAREER Award, McKnight Foundation Technological Innovations in Neuroscience Award, and CIFAR Azrieli Global Scholar Award.</p>

            <h3>Sergey Shuvaev</h3>
            <p>Sergey Shuvaev is a joint postdoc with the NerDS and Pesaran lab at UPenn. He completed his B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics and Physics at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. His Ph.D. focused on machine-learning models of behavior, which he designed in residence at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He devoted his B.Sc. years to developing computer-vision pipelines for neuroimaging, followed by complementing his computational background with experience in electrical engineering during his M.Sc. Sergey is interested in biologically informed models of decision-making, where he combines computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence. His research is currently focused on curating data and building neuro-AI foundation models toward better clinical outcomes in behavioral disorders. Outside work, Sergey is a fan of hiking, cycling, and playing musical instruments.</p>
